## [Description](#description)

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. 

API-for-the-gram is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to followersâ€™ thoughts, and create a follower list. 

No seed data is provided, so youâ€™ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after youâ€™ve created your API.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, youâ€™ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. Youâ€™ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
